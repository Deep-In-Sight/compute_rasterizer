# About

This repository contains the source code for our papers about real-time software rasterization of point clouds, which can be 10 to 100 times faster than GL_POINTS. This is possible because GL_POINTS is built upon the triangle-oriented rendering pipeline that is not optimal for pixel-sized points.

The basic idea is to spawn a compute shader that transforms points to screen space, encodes depth and color into a single 64 bit integer, and uses atomicMin to compute the closest point for each pixel. The color value is then extracted from the interleaved depth+color buffer and converted into a regular OpenGL texture for display. 

The latest improvement also groups about 10k points into batches, and each compute workgroup(128 threads) renders a batch(10k points), i.e., each thread renders about 80 points. This allows several batch-level optimizations such as frustum culling, LOD rendering, and adaptive precision. Adaptive precision picks a sufficient coordinate precision (typically just 10 bit per axis) depending on the projected batch size, which boosts brute-force performance due to lower memory bandwidth requirements.

The main branch is a slightly more user friendly version that allows loading LAS files via drag&drop. Other branches contain snapshots of the code made after evaluations for specific paper submissions:

# Features and Limitations

* Renders up to one billion points in about 8 milliseconds (hence 2 billion points in real-time, 60fps) on an RTX 3090.
* You need to make sure not to load more than your GPU memory can handle. You'll need about 1.6GB for every 100 million points, plus 1GB or 2GB overhead. 
* Drag & Drop a LAS or LAZ files into the window to load it. Only RGB attributes are displayed.
* Requires Windows and NVIDIA GPUs. Pull requests for AMD support are welcome.

# Building

* Clone the repository
* Compile build/ComputeRasterizer.sln with Visual Studio 2022.
* Run (ctrl + f5)
